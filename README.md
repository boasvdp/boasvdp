I'm a public health bioinformatician based at the [RIVM](https://www.rivm.nl/en) in the Netherlands, working for IDS-bioinformatics team which supports other groups through microbial bioinformatics. See our GitHub organisation for what we're working on: https://github.com/rivm-bioinformatics.

I completed my PhD at [Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development(AIGHD)](https://www.aighd.org/), which focused on *Escherichia coli* genomics and antimicrobial resistance. I also did a short postdoc at the [Amsterdam UMC](https://www.amsterdamumc.nl/) and the [Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis (NRLBM)](https://www.amc.nl/web/specialismen/medische-microbiologie-infectiepreventie-1/medische-microbiologie-infectiepreventie-1/nederlands-referentie-laboratorium-voor-bacteriele-meningitis-nrlbm.htm) (page in Dutch).
